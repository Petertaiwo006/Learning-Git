Branching in Git allows developers to create isolated environments for working on features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase. It enables parallel development, simplifies collaboration and code review, and supports various workflows like feature development, hotfixes, and release management. By using branches, teams can efficiently manage and integrate changes, ensuring a stable and organized development process.
